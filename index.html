       <div id = "AboutMe">
           <h2>About Me:</h2>
           <p>My name is Louise Madden. I’m 20 years old and I have just finished my second year of Computer Games Development in University of Limerick.
                I chose to do this course due to a workshop I attended with my class in 6th year of Secondary School. We had a short Java workshop and I found that I really enjoyed it.
                I then discovered the near endless possibilities available when you go on and learn more and learn more languages. 
                 It interested me immediately and I have grown to enjoy it even more. Throughout my 2 years in UL I have learned a variety of languages for
                  different purposes. I have enjoyed exploring the new possibilities with each language and the environment they are used in,
                  such as the different versions of Lua used in Corona and PICO-8.
                <br><br>
                  I have joined several societies including the Games society, Games Development Society, WiSTEM2D(Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, 
                Mathematics, Manufacturing and Design) and briefly the Computer Society. These societies allow me to unwind and enjoy some of my hobbies(Games) and
                 expand my knowledge(Game Development).
                 I am currently the Treasurer of the Game Development Society and I hope to run for the position again in September. </p>

            <p>This is where I'll figure out how to include some of my work(projects, game jam games, save the dragon slay the princess, spooky dodge,
                and a knight's quest). Hopefully that'll work.

       <div id = "Interests">
            <h2>My Interests:</h2>
            <p>Split from skills because I want to use icons for this too possibly. If not its not too hard to just move around. Games, learning 
                programming languages, playing games particularly puzzle games, reading in particular fantasy and fiction and painting/drawing/crafts.
                Which is why I have an interest in software such as GIMP and now Krita thanks to game dev.

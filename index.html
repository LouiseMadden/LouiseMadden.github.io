                <!-- <h2>About Me</h2> -->
                <p>My name is Louise Madden. I’m 20 years old and I have just finished my second year of Computer Games Development in University of Limerick.
                        I chose to do this course due to a workshop I attended with my class in 6th year of Secondary School. We had a short Java workshop and I found that I really enjoyed it.
                        I then discovered the near endless possibilities available when you go on and learn more and learn more languages. 
                        It interested me immediately and I have grown to enjoy it even more. Throughout my 2 years in UL I have learned a variety of languages for
                        different purposes. I have enjoyed exploring the new possibilities with each language and the environment they are used in,
                        such as the different versions of Lua used in Corona and PICO-8.
                        <br><br>
                        I have joined several societies including the Games society, Games Development Society, WiSTEM2D(Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, 
                        Mathematics, Manufacturing and Design) and briefly the Computer Society. These societies allow me to unwind and enjoy some of my hobbies(Games) and
                        expand my knowledge(Game Development).
                        I am currently the Treasurer of the Game Development Society and I hope to run for the position again in September. </p>

        <h2>My Skills</h2>
        <div id = "Skills">
            <div id = "Java" class = "skill-box">
                <i class = 'fab fa-java favi-skill'></i>
                <h3>Java</h3>
                <p>Java is a very useful and versatile language. It's the first programming language that I learned. I have had a lot of 
                    practical experience with the language and have written many programs in Java 
                    for projects and labs. It is also the language that introduced me to programming and 
                    made me realise that this is what I wanted to study. </p>

            <div id = "CAndPlus" class = "skill-box">
                <i class = 'far fa-file favi-skill'></i>
                <h3>C/C++</h3>
                <p>I have had many modules that require C and/or C++, including Operating Systems, 
                    Computer Graphics and Data Structures and Algorithms. I have a basic knowledge of C 
                    and a more in-depth knowledge of C++. I have used QT creator to create a basic text-based 
                    adventure game. I enjoy using C++ as it has a versatile language that allows for many different 
                    types of programs and is also generally a fast and efficient language if used well.</p>
            </div>

            <div id = "MySQL" class = "skill-box">
                <i class = 'fas fa-database favi-skill'></i>
                <h3>MySQL</h3>
                <p>I learned basic MYSQL for my Database Systems module. In this module we learned about 
                    tables, creating, adding, editing and deleting both tables themselves and the data inserted 
                    into them. We also learned constraints and indexes, as well as triggers, functions and procedures. 
                    I enjoyed using MYSQL as it was very organised and efficient for quickly finding information.</p>

            <div id = "HTMLCSS" class = "skill-box">
                <i class = 'fas fa-code favi-skill'></i>
                <h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
                <p>I learned basic HTML and CSS by writing this website. I am teaching it to myself with the help of online guides...and a lot of trial and error.
                    I hope to keep experimenting and learning more of oth of these languages. It is a great way to practise programming and also be creative 
                    while exploring options with layouts and colours.

                <h4>Teamwork</h4>
                <p>I have a lot of experience working in teams, especially in the last 2 years. 
                    Group projects are a very important part of my coursework.

       <div id = "Work">
            <h2>Some Sample Work</h2>
            <p>This is where I'll figure out how to include some of my work(projects, game jam games, save the dragon slay the princess, spooky dodge,
                and a knight's quest). Hopefully that'll work.

                <i class = 'fas fa-book-open favi-int'></i>
                <h3>Reading</h3>
                <p>I am an avid reader. I particularly enjoy reading fantasy and fiction. </p>
            </div>

            <div id = "Games" class = "interest-box">
                <i class = 'fas fa-gamepad favi-int'></i>
                <h3>Games</h3>
                <p>I like playing all kinds of games. I love computer games, particularly RPGs/JRPGs, story based games and platformers. 
                    Some of my favourites are Legend of Zelda games, Pokémon, Mario and Spyro (including the new reignited trilogy!). I also really 
                    enjoy board games, both competitive and cooperative, party games like ludo, and trivial pursuit. I have also learned about many new games through 
                    the Games Society here in UL such as Pandemic and Dixit. I also enjoy Dungeons and Dragons and play regularly both in and out of the society.

            <div id = "Painting" class = "interest-box">
                <i class = 'fas fa-palette favi-int'></i>
                <h3>Painting</h3>
                <p>I have a big interest in art and drawing and painting. I have always enjoyed drawing and painting, and while I may not be the most talented, I have fun at least.
                    I like exploring different styles and trying new things but I do love drawing flowers. I studied art for the leaving cert and it was one of my favourite subjects. 
                    I have also done artwork for games for projects for some of my modules and also for Game Jams. I have also recently joined the Craft Society in UL and am very excited to get started!

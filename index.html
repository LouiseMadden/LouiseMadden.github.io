       <div id = "AboutMe">
           <h2>About Me:</h2>
           <p>My name is Louise Madden. Iâ€™m 20 years old and I have just finished my second year of Computer Games Development in University of Limerick.
                I chose to do this course due to a workshop I attended with my class in 6th year of Secondary School. We had a short Java workshop and I immediately
                 fell in love with programming and the near endless possibilities available when you go on and learn more and learn more languages. 
                 It interested me immediately and now here I am and I love it. Throughout my 2 years in UL I have learned a variety of languages for
                  different purposes and have enjoyed exploring the new possibilities with each language and the environment they are used in,
                  such as using C++ in QT creator to make a text based game or using it with OpenGL to manipulate graphical components?(word better).
                <br><br>
                  I have joined several societies including the Games society, Games Development Society, WiSTEM2D(Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, 
                Mathematics, Manufacturing and Design) and briefly the Computer Society. These societies allow me to unwind and enjoy some of my hobbies(Games),
                 expand my knowledge(Game Development) and meet new people hoping to go into different industries(WiSTEM2D). 
                 I am currently the Treasurer of the Game Development Society and I hope to run for the position again in September. </p>

            <p>This is where I'll figure out how to include some of my work(projects, game jam games, save the dragon slay the princess, spooky dodge,
                and a knight's quest). Hopefully that'll work.

       <div id = "Interests">
            <h2>My Interests:</h2>
            <p>Split from skills because I want to use icons for this too possibly. If not its not too hard to just move around. Games, learning 
                programming languages, playing games particularly puzzle games, reading in particular fantasy and fiction and painting/drawing/crafts.
                Which is why I have an interest in software such as GIMP and now Krita thanks to game dev.

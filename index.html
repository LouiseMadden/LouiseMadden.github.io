       <div id = "AboutMe">
           <h2>About Me:</h2>
           <p>My name is Louise Madden. I'm 19 and in second year of Computer Games Development in the University of Limerick. I love this course and really 
                enjoy all of my modules and am always eager to learn. I love learning new languages and technologies. I'm a regular member of the Games and Game Development
                societies and have recently joined the WiSTEM2D (Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, Manufacturing and Design) society.
                Thanks to this course I know have a good knowledge of the Java programming language, basic C, basic C++, Corona Lua. As a result of my 
                involvement in the Game Development society I know basic PICO-8 Lua, and have a basic knowledge of Unity. I also have a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS 
                from writing this very website.</p>

       <div id = "Skills">
            <h2>My Skills:</h2>
            <p>This is where I will talk about my skills and I'll include icons for each of them</p>

            <h3>Java</h3>
            <i class='fab fa-java' style='font-size:600%;color:rgb(252, 180, 255)'></i>
       </div>

       <div id = "Work">
            <h2>Some Sample Work:</h2>
            <p>This is where I'll figure out how to include some of my work(projects, game jam games, save the dragon slay the princess, spooky dodge,
                and a knight's quest). Hopefully that'll work.
            </p>
       </div>

       <div id = "Interests">
            <h2>My Interests:</h2>
            <p>Split from skills because I want to use icons for this too possibly. If not its not too hard to just move around. Games, learning 
                programming languages, playing games particularly puzzle games, reading in particular fantasy and fiction and painting/drawing/crafts.
                Which is why I have an interest in software such as GIMP and now Krita thanks to game dev.
